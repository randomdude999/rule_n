Default rule is 110, so the example could be shortened to:

    rule_110 = rule_n.RuleN()

This works with any numbered rule numbered in this manner, see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110#Definition> to learn more.

You can also specify a list of actions directly. In this case, 110 would become
[False, True, True, False, True, True, True, False]. See the abovementioned
link for explanation.

You can also specify the list of actions as a string of 0's and 1's. 110 would
be "01101110".

    rule_110 = rule_n.RuleN("01101110")

You can also have a finite canvas:

    rule_110 = rule_n.RuleN(110, canvas_size=5)

A canvas is finite if its size is more than 0.
